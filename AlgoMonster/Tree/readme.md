🧠 How to Solve Each Easy Question (Same Ritual)

	Before writing code, say out loud:

		What pattern is this?

		What do I return?

		Do I carry state or compute from children?

		Pre / In / Post / Level?

		This is what interviewers actually care about.
	

📁 Folder 1: DFS Traversal (Visit Every Node) [Tier 2]

	Goal of this folder

	Get comfortable walking the tree and knowing when to do work.

	Questions

		Binary Tree Preorder Traversal

		Binary Tree Inorder Traversal

		Binary Tree Postorder Traversal

		Count Nodes in a Binary Tree

		Sum of All Nodes in Binary Tree

	🧠 Focus:

		If the problem says “for every node…” → start here
	
		Recursive base case

		Where the “work” goes (before / between / after recursion)

📁 Folder 2: Root → Leaf Path Problems [Tier 1]

	Goal

	Learn to carry state downward + backtrack cleanly.

	Questions

		Path Sum

		Path Sum II (return all paths)

		Binary Tree Paths

		Sum Root to Leaf Numbers

		Path with Given Sequence (variant)

	🧠 Focus:

		Pass path / sum

		Backtracking (remove last)

		Detect leaf correctly

	**Mental hook**

	> “I carry a backpack while walking down.”


📁 Folder 3: Bottom-Up / Postorder (Most Important) [Tier 1]

	Goal

	Children compute → parent decides.

	Questions (🔥 must-do)

		Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

		Balanced Binary Tree

		Diameter of Binary Tree

		Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

		Count Univalue Subtrees

	🧠 Focus:

		Return value meaning

		Global vs returned value

		Postorder traversal

		👉 If you master this folder, you’re senior-level on trees.

	**Mental hook**

	> “Children report up to the parent.”


📁 Folder 4: LCA & Tree as Graph [Tier 2]

	Goal

	Handle ancestors, distances, and “between nodes”.

	Questions

		Lowest Common Ancestor of Binary Tree

		Lowest Common Ancestor of BST

		Distance Between Two Nodes in a Binary Tree

		All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree

		Smallest Subtree with All Deepest Nodes

	🧠 Focus:

		Return node or null

		Early stopping

		Sometimes parent pointers / BFS

	**Mental hook**

	> “Tree + parent = graph.”


📁 Folder 5: Level Order / BFS [Tier 1]

	Goal

	Think in layers, not recursion.

	Questions

		Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

		Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal

		Average of Levels in Binary Tree

		Right Side View of Binary Tree

		Minimum Depth of Binary Tree

	🧠 Focus:

		Queue usage

		Loop per level

		Level size trick

	**Mental hook**

	> “Process one level at a time.”
	

📁 Folder 6: BST-Specific Logic [Tier 3]

	Goal

	Exploit ordering — don’t brute force.

	Questions

		Validate Binary Search Tree

		Search in a BST

		Lowest Common Ancestor of BST

		Kth Smallest Element in a BST

		Convert Sorted Array to BST

	🧠 Focus:

		Inorder = sorted

		Left < root < right

		Pruning logic

📁 Folder 7: Tree Construction / Serialization [Tier 3]

	Goal

	Understand how structure is rebuilt.

	Questions

		Construct Binary Tree from Preorder & Inorder

		Construct Binary Tree from Inorder & Postorder

		Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

		Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree

		Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List

	🧠 Focus:

		Index boundaries

		Recursive construction

		Preorder positioning
